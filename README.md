Credit and many thanks to Ben Frederickson for his source code, along with his work in recommendation algorithms: http://www.benfrederickson.com/distance-metrics/



This program will require the RateBeer dataset which is rather large. It cannot be hosted on GitHub, so please contact me for a copy.
